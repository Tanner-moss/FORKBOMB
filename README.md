DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND RUN THE EXE

I set up some safety measures and timers so that the code will not actually crash your system.
There is an exe file and a .py file. 
If you want to know how it works look at the py file and the comments.
To run the py file you actually have to use powershell C:/path to python3.11.exe  C:/path to forkbomb.py or whatever you name it.
But the exe will run on its own.
